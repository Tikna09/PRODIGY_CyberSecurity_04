# Introduction

Keyloggers are one of the most common tools used by attackers to collect sensitive information by capturing user keystrokes. This project demonstrates how a keystroke monitoring tool works at a technical level.
The purpose of this project is strictly educational— to help students understand malware behavior, detection techniques, and cybersecurity defenses.

**The project is executed in a controlled lab environment using:**

* Windows Machine (victim simulation)
* Kali Linux Machine (listener/server)
* Python keylogger script converted to EXE
* Netcat listener for receiving captured keystrokes
